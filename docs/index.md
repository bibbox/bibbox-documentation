# BIBBOX System

This documentation describes the new angular based Bibbox Docker Framework. <br>
For the old framework documentation see the section **V3 - Old Documentation** below 

## Get started

* What is the Bibbox Framework ?

The Bibbox Framework originally was created to serve as a Biobank in a Box (hence Bibbox). So this means it provides the possibility to create install apps and serve them directly towards the End-User. In the current state we are building apps to support Pathologists and Biobanks in their direct work as well as in Data-Management. The current Framework mainly serves as a workflow demo SAAS-System and is not going into a productive state anytime soon.
