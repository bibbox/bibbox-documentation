## What is DCAT

DCAT stands for Data Catalog Vocabolary and is an RDF vocabulary specifically developed to enhance compatibility among data catalogs which are published and available on the web.

DCAT empowers a data publisher to delineate datasets and data services within a catalog by employing a standardized model and vocabulary, simplifying the retrieval and compilation of metadata from various catalogs. 
This enhances the ability to locate datasets and data services, encourages a decentralized method for publishing data catalogs, and enables federated searches across catalogs from diverse locations, all accomplished through a unified query mechanism and structure.

A detailled description of DCAT and all corresponding iterrelartions and technical terms is given by the World Wide Web Consortium [(W3C)](https://www.w3.org).

## The history of DCAT

The initial DCAT vocabulary was initially crafted and maintained at the Digital Enterprise Research Institute [(DERI)](www.deri.ie).
Subsequently, it underwent further enhancements through the efforts of the [eGov Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/egov/) and ultimately achieved standardization in 2014 [VOCAB-DCAT-1]([https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-1/)) under the purview of the Government Linked Data Working Group [GLD](https://www.w3.org/2011/gld/wiki/Main_Page).

The development of DCAT 2 [VOCAB-DCAT-2](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/) was a response to a fresh set of Use Cases and Requirements [DCAT-UCR](https://www.w3.org/TR/dcat-ucr/) identified based on users' experiences with the original DCAT vocabulary, as well as new applications that were not taken into account during the creation of the initial version. 

The newest version [(DCAT 3)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/) was developed by the [Dataset Exchange Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/wiki/Main_Page), taking into account several crucial use cases and requests that had not been addressed in the previous standardization phase. 
A summary of the alterations from [VOCAB-DCAT-2](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/) can be found in the document's change history section of [Documents Change History](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#changes) of the W3C [(W3C)](https://www.w3.org).


## DCAT and the FAIR data point

DCAT is, among other things, used as a semantic metadata description to form the basis of the [FAIR data point (FDP)](https://github.com/bibbox/bibbox-documentation/blob/master/docs/What_is_FDP.md) metadata content, which is in detail described on [fairdatapoint.org](https://specs.fairdatapoint.org/).

The FAIR principles emphasize the crucial role of metadata, with each of the four principles having a connection to metadata in some manner. Metadata can be described as information that offers insights into other data or, more broadly, information about other digital objects/data. This information encompasses details concerning the source, structure, rights, obligations, or other characteristics of digital objects. The description of the data or digital objects is done on an aggregated level. The approach to metadata within the FAIR Data Point aligns with this concept, supporting the creation of metadata for various types of digital objects.


Within the DCAT model, 'Resources' denote entities that are eligible for the description through a metadata record. As an abstract class, it is not intended for direct usage. Instead, it is recommended to utilize one of its specialized subclasses, such as 'Dataset' or 'Data Service.' A 'Dataset' represents a collection of data, while a 'Data Service' represents services accessible through an interface, like an API, that provide access to datasets. Another relevant subclass, is defined as 'Catalog,' which serves as an aggregation of metadata records pertaining to digital objects. For example, a 'Catalog' might encompass references to metadata records associated with 'Datasets'.
