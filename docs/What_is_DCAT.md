## What is DCAT

DCAT is an RDF vocabulary specifically developed to enhance compatibility among data catalogs which are published and available on the web.

DCAT empowers a data publisher to delineate datasets and data services within a catalog by employing a standardized model and vocabulary, simplifying the retrieval and compilation of metadata from various catalogs. 
This enhances the ability to locate datasets and data services, encourages a decentralized method for publishing data catalogs, and enables federated searches across catalogs from diverse locations, all accomplished through a unified query mechanism and structure.


## The history of DCAT

The initial DCAT vocabulary was initially crafted and maintained at the Digital Enterprise Research Institute (DERI). [Link]
Subsequently, it underwent further enhancements through the efforts of the eGov Interest Group [Link] and ultimately achieved standardization in 2014 [VOCAB-DCAT-1] [Link] under the purview of the Government Linked Data (GLD) Working Group [[Link].

The development of DCAT 2 [VOCAB-DCAT-2] [Link] was a response to a fresh set of Use Cases and Requirements [DCAT-UCR] [Link] identified based on users' experiences with the original DCAT vocabulary, as well as new applications that were not taken into account during the creation of the initial version. 

The newest version (DCAT 3) was developed by the Dataset Exchange Working Group, taking into account several crucial use cases and requests that had not been addressed in the previous standardization phase. 
A summary of the alterations from [VOCAB-DCAT-2] [Link] can be found in the document's change history section of xxx [Link].
