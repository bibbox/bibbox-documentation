# 1B3Africa Model Data Management Policy (MDMP): Frist draft

## 1.1Introduction

This Model Data Management Policy (MDMP) is based on the B3Africa legal framework proposed in this document and will provide a set of formal rules, criteria and priorities that should guarantee a consistent ascertainment of all requirements that should be fulfilled by the platform and by the users of the B3Africa platform. This policy will be implemented as part of the B3Africa final product, the eB3Kit and will pave the way for managing the use of the eB3Kit in control and regulated environments beyond the project&#39;s lifetime.

Policy Principles

- .Based on common standards regarding informed consent and ethical approval. The definition of the concepts will be determined by the applicable law on site. If the applicable law does not regulate these issues, the minimum requirements (section 4.1) will be applied. For all the European users it will be based on the EU Data Protection Directive
- .Compatible with the stated purpose of the B3Africa platform
- .Aims to ensure that the platform meets its obligations towards its stakeholders
- .Facilitate and ensure secure and high quality services for data storage, analysis and sharing
- .Clearly specify what data can be stored, analysed and accessed
- .Clearly specify what data will NOT be stored, analysed or accessed

## 1.2Platform Adoption Procedure

An **Adoption Committee** should be created in order to evaluate adoption requests. Adopting the B3Africa platform means to get the B3Africa hardware and software (_eB3Kit_) to be used in principle, inside the boundaries of a research group, biobank, research institution or other organization related to biomedical research.

The procedure for evaluating the adoption requests will provide the adoption committee with evaluation criteria to be considered when granting the adoption of B3Africa eB3Kit.

In principle, all the member organizations of the B3Africa project are entitled to adopt the platform as well as the institutions participating as use cases. Nevertheless, this policy will pave the way to future adoption of the eB3Kit by other African and European medical-research institutions. It implies that regulations about the adoption of the B3Africa platform should be in place beyond the project&#39;s lifetime. Established organizations as BBMRI-ERIC can be suitable for managing the distribution and management of the B3Africa informatics platform.

This policy will also guarantee standard data access procedures when creating federation of eB3Kit instances or when integrating the eB3Kit with existing e-infrastructures for storage, analysis or sharing purposes.

### 1.2.1Organization Application

The eB3Kit can be acquired by an organization that will manage the use of the eB3Kit. Even when the eB3Kit is acquired by an individual research group, biobank or similar; it is important that the hosting organization is involved in the process. In all the cases, the organization should request the adoption of the B3Africa eB3Kit.
